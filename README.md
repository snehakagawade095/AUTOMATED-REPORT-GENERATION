Description

This project demonstrates automated report generation using Python by reading and analyzing data from a CSV file and creating a formatted PDF report. The dataset used in this task is 50_Startups.csv, which contains financial information related to startup companies, including their profit values. The goal of this task is to perform basic data analysis and present the results in a professional PDF format.

Objective

The main objective of this task is to:

Read data from an external CSV file using Python

Perform basic statistical analysis on the dataset

Automatically generate a well-structured PDF report using ReportLab

Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas – for reading and analyzing CSV data

ReportLab – for creating and formatting the PDF report

Methodology

The script begins by loading the dataset from the CSV file using the Pandas library. Once the data is loaded successfully, statistical calculations are performed on the Profit column to determine the average profit, maximum profit, and minimum profit.

After computing these values, the ReportLab library is used to create a PDF document. The report includes a title, summary statistics, and a data table. The table displays the column headers along with the first ten records from the dataset, providing a quick overview of the data.

Styling is applied to the table to enhance readability, including background color for headers, grid lines, text alignment, and contrasting text colors.

Output

A professionally formatted PDF file named Startup_Profit_Report.pdf

Summary statistics (average, maximum, and minimum profit)

A table containing the first ten records of the dataset

Conclusion

This task successfully demonstrates automated report generation using Python. It fulfills the internship requirement of reading data from a file, performing analysis, and generating a formatted PDF report. The project highlights the practical use of Pandas for data analysis and ReportLab for document creation.
